Task 2: Control Arduino/ESP32 Using Speech To Text:

In this task we have to control the Arduino/ESP32 using speech to text website we have made in Task 1
To be able to control and communicate with the Arduino, we should use the serial port, and to use the serial port in a website we should use the Web Serial API.


Try saying "Right" or "Left" into the microphone provided by the browser, or you can say or "يمين" or "يسار" in Arabic.
In the same way that the servo should turn right if you say "Right" or "يمين" it should also turn left if you say "Left" or "يسار"
